Simple AI Chatbot in C++ (Using Arrays)

This is a beginner-friendly AI Chatbot built in C++ using arrays.
It is specially designed for students who are learning C++ and want to see how arrays can be applied in the real world . 

 Features :- 

🗨️ Responds to simple predefined questions.

📚 Uses arrays to store questions & answers.

🔄 Runs in a loop until the user types exit.

🔡 Converts user input to lowercase for better matching.

💻 Works completely offline, no internet required.


🛠️ How It Works :- 

1. The program stores a set of questions and answers in arrays.
2. User types input → chatbot checks if it matches any stored question.
3. If a match is found → it replies with the corresponding answer.
4. If no match → chatbot politely says it doesn’t understand.
5. Type exit anytime to end the chat.



🧩 Example Conversation :- 

Simple AI Chatbot (C++ + Arrays)
Type 'exit' to quit.

You: hello
Chatbot: Hi there! How can I help you?

You: what is your name
Chatbot: I am your AI Chatbot built in C++!

You: bye
Chatbot: Goodbye! Have a great day!


Key Concepts Used

Arrays → Store questions and answers

Strings → Handle full sentences

Loops → Keep chatbot running until exit

Conditionals → Match input with responses

tolower() → Normalize input for better matching


 How to Run :- 

1. Clone this repository or copy the code.
2. Save the file as chatbot.cpp.
3. Compile the program:
g++ chatbot.cpp -o chatbot
4. Run the chatbot:
./chatbot


Future Improvements :- 

Use file handling to load Q&A from a text file.

Connect with AI models (like GPT) for smarter replies.

Build a GUI version for better user interaction.


About This Project :- 

This project was built as part of my C++ learning journey.
It shows how arrays can be applied in real-world applications and is a great first step toward building more advanced AI projects.
